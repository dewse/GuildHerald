Testing Discord Webhooks (extension of guildRP)

## Brainstorm

### Discord Webhook Chat
Using players that have the addon to transfer the content of a particular chat, like WoW, to discord through the webhook function. This would be a 1-way transfer, but eventually could become a 2-way system. 

It could either be individual players transferring their own chat, or have 1 player transfer all the chat he writes and incoming for him in guild chat. Or it could work as a shared task where a player does it, and then the task is pointed to another with the addon. Or a priority of higher ranked players do it, and if they aren't online, it goes to the 2nd rank. Ideally, I'd rather less maintenance for users, but later in the project for there to be a choice if people don't want to default to the no-config mode.
